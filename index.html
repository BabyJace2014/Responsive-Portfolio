          <p>Hello, Iâ€™m Jeffrey Lempicki and I am currently attending Rutgers to become a certified full-stack web developer.  I have serious passion for UI effects, animations and creating intuitive, dynamic user experiences.  Currently we are learning how to make HTML Web Pages using CSS and Bootstrap.  I am working towards becoming a full-stack developer to prepare for my second career in life.</p>

          <p>I currently have no experience at all with computer coding, however by the end of class I am confident that I will be an asset to any company that gives me an opportunity to work for them.</p>
